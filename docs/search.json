    "text": "Moving to a new country changes everything—including how you find your way around. My journey from Ghana to Canada taught me that navigation isn’t just about maps and directions. It’s about feeling at home in a new place.\n\n\nBack home in Ghana, I never needed GPS. Getting around was easy and natural. Every neighborhood had its own personality—unique buildings, familiar shops, and streets that felt different from each other. Finding places meant looking for landmarks everyone knew: “Turn at the red building,” “Stop at the corner shop,” or “It’s three houses past the tall fence.”\nThis way of navigating worked because I grew up there. I knew the stories behind every street corner. Every building meant something. GPS wasn’t necessary when your surroundings felt like an old friend.\n\n\n\nArriving in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) was like landing on a different planet. The first thing I noticed? All the houses looked exactly the same. Street after street of similar buildings, identical driveways, and matching fences. Where were the unique landmarks I was used to?\nDuring my first few months, simple trips became major challenges. Going to the grocery store or meeting a friend required serious planning and memorization. Without the familiar visual cues from home, every journey felt like navigating through a maze where all the walls were identical.\nI’ll be honest—it was tough. Really tough.\n\n\n\nThose first weeks meant constantly checking my phone for directions. Even short walks required GPS assistance. I became anxious about my phone battery dying or losing data connection. This dependency would have seemed crazy back home, but here it was survival.\nBut humans adapt. Slowly, I started recognizing patterns. Certain intersections became familiar. The subtle differences between shopping plazas started making sense. Bus stops turned from confusing waypoints into reliable landmarks. What looked like endless suburban sprawl gradually revealed its hidden character.\n\n\n\nCanada’s digital navigation tools are lifesavers for newcomers like me. Apps for the TTC and other transit systems don’t just give directions—they give confidence. They let you explore without fear of getting lost.\nThese apps do more than help you find places. They help you feel brave enough to discover new neighborhoods, try new restaurants, and navigate complex transit systems. When you know you can always find your way home, you’re more willing to explore.\n\n\n\nWhat surprised me most is that even people who’ve lived in Canada for decades use GPS apps regularly. Even those born and raised here pull out their phones when going somewhere new. The GTA is huge—over 7,000 square kilometers. No one person can know it all.\nThis shared reliance on technology creates an interesting situation. Whether you’re a newcomer from Ghana or a lifelong Toronto resident, exploring unfamiliar areas often requires the same digital help. GPS doesn’t just help immigrants adapt—it helps everyone navigate confidently.\n\n\n\nThe journey from constant GPS checking to knowing my way around took time. First, my work-to-home route became automatic. No more checking directions for that daily commute! Then familiar routes slowly expanded into broader knowledge of the area.\nEach successful trip without GPS felt like a small victory. Building confidence in navigation mirrors other aspects of adapting to a new culture. Just like learning a new language through daily practice, understanding a new city’s geography comes through repeated exploration.\n\n\n\nGPS technology does something important for newcomers—it removes one of the biggest fears about living in a new place: getting lost. When you know you can navigate safely, you’re more likely to explore, try new things, and gradually build the local knowledge that makes a place feel like home.\nThese apps serve as training wheels. They provide security while you develop the confidence and familiarity needed to eventually explore independently. GPS helps bridge the gap between feeling lost and feeling at home.\n\n\n\nToday, I’ve found a comfortable balance. Familiar routes flow naturally without any tech help—I know my neighborhood like I once knew the streets of Ghana. For new destinations, I still rely on GPS, and that’s perfectly fine.\nThis mixed approach, combining growing local knowledge with digital tools, makes sense for modern urban life in Canada. The experience taught me that technology can help you adapt while building real confidence for independent living.\n\n\n\nMy navigation journey highlights something important: technology can bridge cultural experiences. It enables adaptation while preserving the confidence necessary for truly making a new place home. Whether you’re discovering your first Canadian neighborhood or exploring a distant part of the city, GPS ensures every journey can be undertaken with confidence.\nIn a country as big as Canada, digital navigation isn’t just convenient—it’s essential. It’s what makes urban exploration and cultural discovery possible, helping any place eventually feel like home.\nThe funny thing is, after all this adaptation, I now know my local routes so well that I walk and take buses without any map assistance. But step outside my familiar area? You bet I’m pulling out that GPS app like everyone else.\n\nFor newcomers to Canada, apps like Google Maps, Citymapper, and local transit apps are invaluable during those first months. They don’t just help you get around—they help build the confidence you need to make your new city feel like home."

    "section": "",
    "text": "When I first received the opportunity to serve as one of the organizers for the 2025 Northeastern University Global Symposium on Leadership & Project Management, I had no idea how transformative this experience would become. What started as an invitation to contribute to a prestigious academic gathering evolved into a masterclass in collaboration, digital strategy, and the art of bringing together brilliant minds from around the world.\n\n\nAs the self-proclaimed “digital alchemist” of our organizing team, my role encompassed far more than I initially anticipated. From crafting compelling email campaigns for participants and managing social media announcements for our stellar lineup of spotlight speakers, every day brought new challenges and opportunities to learn. The digital landscape of academic event management proved to be a fascinating blend of strategic communication, technical coordination, and relationship building.\nThe symposium, scheduled for August 21-22, 2025, served as a premier gathering of thought leaders, industry experts, and scholars dedicated to advancing leadership and project management. Being part of the team that made this vision a reality was both humbling and exhilarating.\n\n\n\nNone of this would have been possible without the instrumental support of Dr. Behnaz Merikhi, whose belief in my potential opened doors I never imagined could be within reach. Dr. Merikhi, an Assistant Teaching Professor in the Master of Professional Studies in Informatics program at Northeastern University, Toronto, brings a wealth of expertise with her PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Concordia University. Her academic excellence is matched only by her generous mentorship spirit.\nDr. Merikhi didn’t just provide an opportunity; she created a bridge to connect with Northeastern’s prestigious faculty network. Her guidance throughout this journey has been invaluable, and I’m deeply grateful for her faith in my abilities to contribute meaningfully to such a significant academic endeavor. You can connect with Dr. Merikhi and learn more about her groundbreaking work in informatics and network optimization through her Northeastern University faculty profile.\n\n\n\nWorking alongside Northeastern’s distinguished faculty taught me that academic excellence thrives on genuine collaboration. Each email strategy session, each social media campaign, and each coordination meeting revealed the meticulous planning and passionate dedication that go into creating a world-class symposium. The faculty members I had the privilege to work with demonstrated not only their expertise in leadership and project management but also their commitment to fostering the next generation of professionals in these fields.\nThe experience of managing participant communications taught me the delicate balance between professionalism and warmth that’s essential in academic outreach. Every message we sent represented not just information, but an invitation to be part of something larger – a global conversation about the future of leadership and project management.\n\n\n\nThe role of “digital alchemist” became a perfect metaphor for what we accomplished together. Like ancient alchemists who sought to transform base materials into gold, our team transformed ideas, schedules, speaker profiles, and logistical details into engaging digital content that attracted participants from around the globe. Whether it was crafting the perfect subject line for a participant email or timing social media announcements for maximum engagement, every digital touchpoint was an opportunity to create something valuable.\nThe spotlight speaker announcements were particularly rewarding to manage. Seeing the excitement build across social platforms as we revealed each distinguished speaker reminded me of the power of strategic digital communication in the academic world.\n\n\n\nThe symposium has concluded, and what an extraordinary gathering of minds it turned out to be! Witnessing months of strategic planning come to fruition was deeply rewarding. The experience as part of the organizers to the event has been more than educational – it’s been transformational. Working with Northeastern University’s exceptional faculty, collaborating with fellow organizers, and contributing to an event that impacted leaders and project managers globally has been a privilege I’ll carry with me throughout my career.\nTo everyone who joined us for the 2025 Global Symposium on Leadership & Project Management, thank you for validating the months of passionate work, strategic planning, and collaborative effort our team invested in creating an experience worthy of your expertise and engagement.\n\n\n\nThis journey has reinforced my belief that the most meaningful professional experiences come from the relationships we build and the mentors who believe in our potential. Dr. Behnaz Merikhi’s support exemplifies the best academic mentorship – generous, visionary, and deeply committed to student success.\nTo my lead organizers, the faculty members who welcomed me into their planning processes, and the participants who made the symposium a success: thank you for allowing me to be part of something truly special.\n\nThe 2025 Northeastern University Global Symposium on Leadership & Project Management took place on August 21-22, 2025.

    "title": "From Customer Service to AI Explainability: Why SHAP Matters in the Real World",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Working as a customer service representative at Freedom, where I handled credit checks and customer inquiries, taught me one of the most valuable lessons of my career: people deserve to understand the decisions that affect their lives. Every day presented a familiar scenario that played out like clockwork across countless interactions.\n\n\nThe routine was predictable yet always carried an undercurrent of tension. A customer would approach, hopeful about their application. I’d run their credit check, watching the system process their financial history in real-time. The outcome was binary and immediate—either the green light of approval accompanied by smiles and congratulations, or the red light of decline followed by disappointed faces and inevitable questions.\nThe most challenging part wasn’t delivering bad news; it was the aftermath. Without fail, declined customers would ask the question that haunted every interaction: “But why was I declined?” Armed with nothing more than a system verdict and standard protocols, my response was frustratingly inadequate: “Perhaps there’s an issue with your banking information. You might want to contact your financial institution for clarification.”\nThis experience highlighted a fundamental problem in automated decision-making systems—the opacity that leaves both customers and representatives in the dark about the reasoning behind critical financial decisions.\n\n\n\nThis frustration with black-box decision-making led me to discover SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), a groundbreaking approach to machine learning interpretability. SHAP functions as a sophisticated translator between complex AI models and human understanding, providing detailed insights into why specific decisions are made.\nRather than simply rendering binary judgments, SHAP breaks down each prediction into comprehensible components. It illuminates how individual factors—payment history patterns, debt-to-income ratios, historical financial behaviors, and even specific incidents like that late car payment from 2022—collectively influence the model’s final decision. This granular analysis transforms impenetrable algorithmic decisions into transparent, understandable explanations.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe financial services industry thrives on trust, and transparency is its foundation. When institutions can provide specific, data-driven explanations for their decisions, they transform potentially frustrating experiences into educational opportunities. Instead of leaving customers to speculate about rejection reasons, banks can offer concrete feedback: “Your application was declined primarily due to recent late payments affecting 60% of the decision, combined with current debt utilization impacting 25% of the evaluation.”\nThis level of transparency doesn’t just improve customer satisfaction—it builds lasting relationships based on understanding rather than frustration.\n\n\n\nIn highly regulated sectors like finance and healthcare, algorithmic accountability isn’t just beneficial—it’s mandatory. Regulatory frameworks increasingly require institutions to demonstrate that their automated decision-making processes are fair, unbiased, and legally defensible. SHAP provides the analytical framework necessary to meet these requirements by offering detailed documentation of decision factors and their relative importance.\nThis capability becomes particularly crucial when addressing potential bias in lending practices, hiring decisions, or medical diagnoses, where unexplained algorithmic decisions can have serious legal and ethical implications.\n\n\n\nFor data scientists and machine learning engineers, SHAP offers invaluable diagnostic capabilities.

    "text": "The routine was predictable yet always carried an undercurrent of tension. A customer would approach, hopeful about their application. I’d run their credit check, watching the system process their financial history in real-time. The outcome was binary and immediate—either the green light of approval accompanied by smiles and congratulations, or the red light of decline followed by disappointed faces and inevitable questions.\nThe most challenging part wasn’t delivering bad news; it was the aftermath. Without fail, declined customers would ask the question that haunted every interaction: “But why was I declined?” Armed with nothing more than a system verdict and standard protocols, my response was frustratingly inadequate: “Perhaps there’s an issue with your banking information. You might want to contact your financial institution for clarification.”\nThis experience highlighted a fundamental problem in automated decision-making systems—the opacity that leaves both customers and representatives in the dark about the reasoning behind critical financial decisions."

    "text": "This frustration with black-box decision-making led me to discover SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), a groundbreaking approach to machine learning interpretability. SHAP functions as a sophisticated translator between complex AI models and human understanding, providing detailed insights into why specific decisions are made.\nRather than simply rendering binary judgments, SHAP breaks down each prediction into comprehensible components. It illuminates how individual factors—payment history patterns, debt-to-income ratios, historical financial behaviors, and even specific incidents like that late car payment from 2022—collectively influence the model’s final decision. This granular analysis transforms impenetrable algorithmic decisions into transparent, understandable explanations."

    "text": "The financial services industry thrives on trust, and transparency is its foundation. When institutions can provide specific, data-driven explanations for their decisions, they transform potentially frustrating experiences into educational opportunities. Instead of leaving customers to speculate about rejection reasons, banks can offer concrete feedback: “Your application was declined primarily due to recent late payments affecting 60% of the decision, combined with current debt utilization impacting 25% of the evaluation.”\nThis level of transparency doesn’t just improve customer satisfaction—it builds lasting relationships based on understanding rather than frustration.\n\n\n\nIn highly regulated sectors like finance and healthcare, algorithmic accountability isn’t just beneficial—it’s mandatory. Regulatory frameworks increasingly require institutions to demonstrate that their automated decision-making processes are fair, unbiased, and legally defensible. SHAP provides the analytical framework necessary to meet these requirements by offering detailed documentation of decision factors and their relative importance.\nThis capability becomes particularly crucial when addressing potential bias in lending practices, hiring decisions, or medical diagnoses, where unexplained algorithmic decisions can have serious legal and ethical implications.\n\n\n\nFor data scientists and machine learning engineers, SHAP offers invaluable diagnostic capabilities. It provides unprecedented visibility into model behavior, revealing when algorithms rely disproportionately on problematic features or exhibit unexpected patterns. This insight enables teams to identify and address issues like geographical bias in credit scoring or demographic disparities in approval rates before they impact real customers."

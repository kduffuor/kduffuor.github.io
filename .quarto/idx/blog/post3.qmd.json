Dr. Merikhi, an Assistant Teaching Professor in the Master of Professional Studies in Informatics program at Northeastern University, Toronto, brings a wealth of expertise with her PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Concordia University. Her academic excellence is matched only by her generous mentorship spirit.\n\nDr. Merikhi didn't just provide an opportunity; she created a bridge to connect with Northeastern's prestigious faculty network. Her guidance throughout this journey has been invaluable, and I'm deeply grateful for her faith in my abilities to contribute meaningfully to such a significant academic endeavor. You can connect with Dr. Merikhi and learn more about her groundbreaking work in informatics and network optimization through her [Northeastern University faculty profile](https://cps.northeastern.edu/faculty/behnaz-merikhi/).\n\n## Lessons in Collaboration\n\nWorking alongside Northeastern's distinguished faculty taught me that academic excellence thrives on genuine collaboration. Each email strategy session, each social media campaign, and each coordination meeting revealed the meticulous planning and passionate dedication that go into creating a world-class symposium. The faculty members I had the privilege to work with demonstrated not only their expertise in leadership and project management but also their commitment to fostering the next generation of professionals in these fields.\n\nThe experience of managing participant communications taught me the delicate balance between professionalism and warmth that's essential in academic outreach. Every message we sent represented not just information, but an invitation to be part of something larger—a global conversation about the future of leadership and project management.\n\n## Digital Alchemy in Action\n\nThe role of \"digital alchemist\" became a perfect metaphor for what we accomplished together. Like ancient alchemists who sought to transform base materials into gold, our team transformed ideas, schedules, speaker profiles, and logistical details into engaging digital content that attracted participants from around the globe. Whether it was crafting the perfect subject line for a participant email or timing social media announcements for maximum engagement, every digital touchpoint was an opportunity to create something valuable.\n\nThe spotlight speaker announcements were particularly rewarding to manage. Seeing the excitement build across social platforms as we revealed each distinguished speaker reminded me of the power of strategic digital communication in the academic world.\n\n## Reflecting on Success\n\nThe symposium has concluded, and what an extraordinary gathering of minds it turned out to be! Witnessing months of strategic planning come to fruition was deeply rewarding. The experience as part of the organizers to the event has been more than educational—it's been transformational. Working with Northeastern University's exceptional faculty, collaborating with fellow organizers, and contributing to an event that impacted leaders and project managers globally has been a privilege I'll carry with me throughout my career.\n\nTo everyone who joined us for the [2025 Global Symposium on Leadership & Project Management](https://pmsymposium.cps.northeastern.edu/), thank you for validating the months of passionate work, strategic planning, and collaborative effort our team invested in creating an experience worthy of your expertise and engagement.\n\n## A Note of Gratitude\n\nThis journey has reinforced my belief that the most meaningful professional experiences come from the relationships we build and the mentors who believe in our potential. Dr. Behnaz Merikhi's support exemplifies the best academic mentorship—generous, visionary, and deeply committed to student success.\n\nTo my lead organizers, the faculty members who welcomed me into their planning processes, and the participants who made the symposium a success: thank you for allowing me to be part of something truly special.\n\n---\n\n*The 2025 Northeastern University Global Symposium on Leadership & Project Management took place on August 21-22, 2025.

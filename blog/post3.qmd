# Behind the Scenes: My Journey as a Digital Alchemist at Northeastern University's Global Symposium

When I first received the opportunity to serve as one of the organizers for the [2025 Northeastern University Global Symposium on Leadership & Project Management](https://pmsymposium.cps.northeastern.edu/), I had no idea how transformative this experience would become. What started as an invitation to contribute to a prestigious academic gathering evolved into a masterclass in collaboration, digital strategy, and the art of bringing together brilliant minds from around the world.

## The Magic Behind the Curtain

As the self-proclaimed "digital alchemist" of our organizing team, my role encompassed far more than I initially anticipated. From crafting compelling email campaigns for participants and managing social media announcements for our stellar lineup of spotlight speakers, every day brought new challenges and opportunities to learn. The digital landscape of academic event management proved to be a fascinating blend of strategic communication, technical coordination, and relationship building.

The symposium, scheduled for August 21-22, 2025, served as a premier gathering of thought leaders, industry experts, and scholars dedicated to advancing leadership and project management. Being part of the team that made this vision a reality was both humbling and exhilarating.

## A Pivotal Connection

None of this would have been possible without the instrumental support of **Dr. Behnaz Merikhi**, whose belief in my potential opened doors I never imagined could be within reach. Dr. Merikhi, an Assistant Teaching Professor in the Master of Professional Studies in Informatics program at Northeastern University, Toronto, brings a wealth of expertise with her PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Concordia University. Her academic excellence is matched only by her generous mentorship spirit.

Dr. Merikhi didn't just provide an opportunity; she created a bridge to connect with Northeastern's prestigious faculty network. Her guidance throughout this journey has been invaluable, and I'm deeply grateful for her faith in my abilities to contribute meaningfully to such a significant academic endeavor. You can connect with Dr. Merikhi and learn more about her groundbreaking work in informatics and network optimization through her [Northeastern University faculty profile](https://cps.northeastern.edu/faculty/behnaz-merikhi/).

## Lessons in Collaboration

Working alongside Northeastern's distinguished faculty taught me that academic excellence thrives on genuine collaboration. Each email strategy session, each social media campaign, and each coordination meeting revealed the meticulous planning and passionate dedication that go into creating a world-class symposium. The faculty members I had the privilege to work with demonstrated not only their expertise in leadership and project management but also their commitment to fostering the next generation of professionals in these fields.

The experience of managing participant communications taught me the delicate balance between professionalism and warmth that's essential in academic outreach. Every message we sent represented not just information, but an invitation to be part of something larger—a global conversation about the future of leadership and project management.

## Digital Alchemy in Action

The role of "digital alchemist" became a perfect metaphor for what we accomplished together. Like ancient alchemists who sought to transform base materials into gold, our team transformed ideas, schedules, speaker profiles, and logistical details into engaging digital content that attracted participants from around the globe. Whether it was crafting the perfect subject line for a participant email or timing social media announcements for maximum engagement, every digital touchpoint was an opportunity to create something valuable.

The spotlight speaker announcements were particularly rewarding to manage. Seeing the excitement build across social platforms as we revealed each distinguished speaker reminded me of the power of strategic digital communication in the academic world.

## Reflecting on Success

The symposium has concluded, and what an extraordinary gathering of minds it turned out to be! Witnessing months of strategic planning come to fruition was deeply rewarding. The experience as part of the organizers to the event has been more than educational—it's been transformational. Working with Northeastern University's exceptional faculty, collaborating with fellow organizers, and contributing to an event that impacted leaders and project managers globally has been a privilege I'll carry with me throughout my career.

To everyone who joined us for the [2025 Global Symposium on Leadership & Project Management](https://pmsymposium.cps.northeastern.edu/), thank you for validating the months of passionate work, strategic planning, and collaborative effort our team invested in creating an experience worthy of your expertise and engagement.

## A Note of Gratitude

This journey has reinforced my belief that the most meaningful professional experiences come from the relationships we build and the mentors who believe in our potential. Dr. Behnaz Merikhi's support exemplifies the best academic mentorship—generous, visionary, and deeply committed to student success.

To my lead organizers, the faculty members who welcomed me into their planning processes, and the participants who made the symposium a success: thank you for allowing me to be part of something truly special.
